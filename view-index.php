              <p class="card-text">This organization was formed by two students at the University of Oklahoma. Alexie Alexiev and Caled Albirini decided to take their passion for health and fitness to the next level. In order to make that happen, they developed training programs and exercises for people of all experience levels, regardless of their progress in their fitness journey. This website will allow to you access information about these programs, including the goal of each workout plan, the locations for which the training is hosted, and each trainer's contact information. Feel free to reach out to them by accessing their contact information on the "Meet Our Trainers" page!</p>
